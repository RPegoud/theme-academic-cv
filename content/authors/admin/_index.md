I'm currently studying in the [**Computational Statistics and Machine Learning MSc**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning-msc) program at [**UCL**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I'm looking forward to pursue a PhD in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and am particularly interested in using methods from Open-Endedness to solve alignment from an RL perspective. For more details, feel free to take a look at my [**research proposal**](/uploads/Research_Proposal.pdf).

Previously, I was a lecturer at [EPF Engineering School](https://www.epf.fr) in charge of the Natural Language Processing module, while working on independent research in Reinforcement Learning.

I completed an MEng in Data Engineering at [EPF Engineering School](https://www.epf.fr) during which I worked on anomaly detection in time series at [BMW](https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/de/en.html) and multilingual text classification at [CEWE](https://www.cewe.fr).
