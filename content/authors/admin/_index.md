I'm a part-time lecturer in Natural Language Processing at [EPF Engineering School](https://www.epf.fr) as well as an independent researcher in Reinforcement Learning.

I completed an MEng in Data Engineering at [EPF Engineering School](https://www.epf.fr) during which I worked on anomaly detection in time series at [BMW](https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/de/en.html) and multilingual text classification at [CEWE](https://www.cewe.fr).

In September 2024, I will join the [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning MSc](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning-msc) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
